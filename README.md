## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This repository demonstrates a simple web interface calling a [Flask] API to invoke network inspection calls using the [Scapy] framework.

## ðŸ’¾ Setup

Scapy has a _lot_ of optional dependencies! Those for Linux can be installed using `just install_fedora` and `just install_ubuntu`.
The Node.js and Python dependencies can be installed using `just install`.

## ðŸš€ Run

Open a terminal and run [Just]. The `sudo` used in the command is often required due to file and network I/O.

## ðŸ§ª Test

Whilst the web app is running, open a separate terminal and run the integration test suite with `just test`.
This uses [Playwright] headless browser tests to verify the UI works as expected.
You can see these in a browser using `just test_interactive`.
Screenshots of successful tests are stored in the [`screenshots`](/screenshots/) directory.
