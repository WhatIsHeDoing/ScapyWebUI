## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This repository demonstrates a simple web interface calling a [Flask] API to invoke network inspection calls using the [Scapy] framework.

## ðŸ’¾ Setup

Scapy has a _lot_ of optional dependencies! Those for Fedora can be installed using `make install_fedora`.
Most of the Python dependencies can be installed using `make install_python`.

## ðŸš€ Run

Open a terminal and run `make`. The `sudo` used in the command is often required due to file and network I/O.

## ðŸ§ª Test

Whilst the web app is running, open a separate terminal and run the integration test suite with `make test`.
This uses [Playwright] headless browser tests to verify the UI works as expected.
You can see these in a browser using `make test_interactive`.
Screenshots of successful tests are stored in the [`screenshots`](/screenshots/) directory.
